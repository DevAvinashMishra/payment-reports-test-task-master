# Payment Reports

This is the base folder for the exercise made with React.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/ChetanRath/payment-reports-test-task.git
cd payment-reports-test-task
```

### Installing Server Dependencies

```
yarn or npm install
```

### Installing dependencies for client 
Open project directory terminal and hit following command:

```
yarn or npm install
```

### Adding env variables for the client
 Make a .env file at root path. There is also an `env.example` file at root for the reference environment file.
env file would look like something:
 ```
 REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL=<server url>
 ```

### Starting the client
 After you have followed the above steps successfully, Run the following command at your root project:

```
yarn run start OR npm run start
```

The client will get started at `localhost:3000` and you can now explore the Test Task

### Developement System Configurations:
OS - MacOS
NODEJS - v14.17.6
NPM - v6.14.15
YARN - v1.22.17

## More Considerations in test task in case provided more time

1. More Refined Architecture with ESLINT setup and stuff

2. More pixel perfectness to the UI

3. Test cases

4. Centralised State Management with redux toolkit or react query

5. Any typings of d3 js were taking more time so they have been kept as such and could have been resolved in more time

6. Mobile and responsive
